  abstract   = {Simple axi-symmetric uni-axial compression tests have been realized on dry loose samples of glass beads (diameters d: d=0.2 {$\pm$} 0.05 mm, 0.75 {$\pm$} 0.1 mm, or 3 mm) and on Hostun sand under small lateral confinement, {$\sigma$}3{$<$}60 kPa, using different sample sizes. The experiments with the two smallest spheres (d=0.2 and 0.75 mm) exhibit stick-slips, which are characterized by (i) a rapid release {$\Delta$}q of the deviatoric stress q and by (ii) the strain {$\Delta\epsilon$}1 separating two events. The samples which exhibit stick-slip also present a weakening of strength q({$\epsilon$}1) as the rate of deformation d{$\epsilon$}1/dt is increased. No stick-slip is generated during the first part of the q-{$\epsilon$}1 curve, i.e. when q grows fast with {$\epsilon$}1. Four different parameters helped us determine the statistics of {$\Delta$}q and {$\Delta\epsilon$}: the lateral pressure {$\sigma$}3{${'}$}, the rate of deformation d{$\epsilon$}1/dt, the sample height H, and the diameter D. The statistics do not depend on rate history. They look like exponentials in small samples and/or in (large sample+fast d{$\epsilon$}1/dt), and they look like Poissonian or Gaussian in (Large sample+small d{$\epsilon$}1/dt). This change in statistics is attributed to a varying of triggering process starting from a single random event in small samples to multiple random events. We have interpreted this change of statistics as due to some finite size effect so that the representative elementary volume shall contain at least (200)3 grains. Localization of deformation is visible at the end of compression but cannot be detected from stick-slip statistics nor from q vs {$\epsilon$} curve.

  abstract   = {A comparison of GPS and seismic analyses of 23 distinct episodic tremor and slip events, located throughout the Cascadia subduction zone over an 11-year period, yields a highly linear relationship between moment release, as estimated from GPS, and total duration of nonvolcanic tremor, as summed from regional seismic arrays. The events last 1\textendash 5 weeks, typically produce {$\sim$}5 mm of static forearc deformation, and show cumulative totals of tremor that range from 40 to 280 h. Moment released by each event is estimated by inverting GPS-measured deformation, which is sensitive to all rates of tremor-synchronous faulting, including aseismic creep, for total slip along the North American-Juan de Fuca plate interface. Tremor, which is shown to be largely invariant in amplitude and frequency content both between events and with respect to its duration, is quantified using several different parameterizations that agree to within 10\%. All known Cascadia events detected since 1997, which collectively span the Cascadia arc from northern California to Vancouver Island, Canada, release moment during tremor at a rate of 5.2 {$\pm$} 0.4 \texttimes{} 1016 N m per hour of recorded tremor. This relationship enables estimation of moment dissipation, via seismic monitoring of tremor, along the deeper Cascadia subduction zone that poses the greatest threat to its major metropolitan centers.},

  abstract = {Recent results from paleoseismology suggest that earthquakes recurrent on a given fault may often have the same characteristic length and amount of slip. Stable asperities and barriers, which survive many earthquakes, can explain these results. The activity of Volcano Usu, Japan, since 1977 which produced a dacite dome with a total upheaval of 180 m, offered a great opportunity to study the recurrence behavior of a fault. Seismologists at Hokkaido University revealed a family of repeated earthquakes with nearly the same amount of slip generated from the same fault plane on the crater wall, along which the dome moved upward. This family can be explained by the existence of a stable asperity on the crater wall and is called the ``asperity-type'' family. They found, however, another type of family of earthquakes, which share the same fault plane but show a great range of variation in the amount of slip. The behavior of the latter family can be explained by the presence of weak barriers over a fault plane defined by strong stable barriers, and this family is referred to as the ``barrier-type'' family. This type of earthquake model has been used successfully in the interpretation of observed strong motion acceleration spectra from California, and the results reveal the stability of local stress drop among different earthquakes. The agreement found between local stress drops estimated from strong motion data and those inferred from geological observation supports the possibility for predicting earthquake strong motion directly from geological observation of the causative fault.}

His results and other pertinent data, interpreted in terms of the barrier model of Das and Aki (1977), suggest that the rupture may be stopped by a barrier with the specific fracture energy of about 109 erg cm-2. Using the formulas of Ida (1973a), we estimated parameters of the barrier as follows: breaking slip of about 20 cm, cohesive stress of about 100 bars, and length of end zone (nonelastic zone) of a few hundred meters. The barrier parameters for the great 1857 earthquake were also obtained from the description of surface fault breaks by Wallace (1968). The result led to the estimation of maximum acceleration of about 1.5g near the fault, under the assumption that the end zone length is proportional to the diameter of individual crack of the barrier model. Barriers for other earthquakes are discussed, and they are classified into geometrical barriers such as fault bend and corner and inhomogeneous barriers such as the high-velocity anomaly straddling the San Andreas fault near San Juan Bautista. The barriers act not only as a stopper of rupture but also as an initiator of rupture, as well as a stress concentrator, causing twin earthquakes and migration or progression of major earthquakes along the plate boundary.},

  abstract  = {Important progress has been made in the study of the earthquake mechanism during the Upper Mantle Project, through the establishment of an appropriate mathematical framework which relates the observed seismogram with the slip motion across a fault plane. Since an arbitrary fault slip is described by a function of time and two space coordinates, a complete inversion of the observed seismogram is practically impossible. The only practical inversion method is to describe the kinematics of rupture growth along a fault plane using a small number of source parameters, and then to determine those parameters from the seismograms. A number of kinematic models have been proposed to cover a class of earthquakes. Preliminary attempts have also been made to find dynamic models by solving the problem of spontaneous rupture propagation for given initial conditions. There are a few source parameters, which represent some averaged quantities over the source time and source space and are therefore independent of the details of rupture kinematics. They are: (1) the seismic moment, which is proportional to the total displacement averaged over the fault surface; and (2) the apparent stress, which is proportional to the ratio of total seismic energy to seismic moment. In addition to these, the average stress drop can be approximately calculated from the seismic moment and the fault area, without detailed knowledge of the kinematics. The accuracies of determining these average quantities are discussed for the Parkfield, California earthquake of 1966, one of the best studied earthquakes during the U.M.P. period. Recent results from several well-studied earthquakes are then summarized as: (1) the relation between magnitude and seismic moment; and (2) the relation between stress-drop and magnitude. It was found that the stress drop in shallow earthquakes is 1 0 \textendash{} 100 bar, apparently independent of magnitude for M {$>$} 6. Finally, recent evidences for the fault origin of deep-focus earthquakes are presented.},

A procedure was developed for an accurate estimation of moment magnitude from the measurement of coda amplitude as a function of lapse time. The cumulative number of earthquakes per unit time period and area was estimated by finding the detection limit for ts-p for each magnitude. We found a clear depature of the observed log frequency-magnitude relation for M {$<$} 3 from the linear relation extrapolated from the data for M {$>$} 3. The observed frequency of earthquakes with M {$\simeq$} 0.5 is almost 10 times less than that expected from the extrapolation of empirical relation for earthquakes with magnitudes larger than 3. We conclude that the observed frequency-magnitude relation departs from self-similarity for earthquakes with magnitude smaller than about 3. This departure coincides with the widely observed departure of the moment-corner frequency relation from self-similarity. These observations are consistent with the interpretation of {$f$}max of large earthquakes in terms of the slip-weakening instability model in which the critical slip may be a few tenths of a meter to a few meters and the cohesive zone size may be a few hundred meters to a few kilometers.},

  abstract = {The onset of frictional motion is mediated by rupture-like slip fronts, which nucleate locally and propagate eventually along the entire interface causing global sliding. The static friction coefficient is a macroscopic measure of the applied force at this particular instant when the frictional interface loses stability. However, experimental studies are known to present important scatter in the measurement of static friction; the origin of which remains unexplained. Here, we study the nucleation of local slip at interfaces with slip-weakening friction of random strength and analyze the resulting variability in the measured global strength. Using numerical simulations that solve the elastodynamic equations, we observe that multiple slip patches nucleate simultaneously, many of which are stable and grow only slowly, but one reaches a critical length and starts propagating dynamically. We show that a theoretical criterion based on a static equilibrium solution predicts quantitatively well the onset of frictional sliding. We develop an efficient Monte-Carlo model by adapting the theoretical criterion and study the variability in global strength distribution caused by the stochastic properties of local frictional strength. The results demonstrate that an increasing spatial correlation length on the interface, representing geometric imperfections and roughness, causes lower global static friction. Conversely, smaller correlation length increases the macroscopic strength while its variability decreases. We further show that randomness in local friction properties is insufficient for the existence of systematic precursory slip events. Random or systematic non-uniformity in the driving force, such as potential energy or stress drop, is required for arrested slip fronts. Our model and observations provide a necessary framework for efficient stochastic analysis of macroscopic frictional strength and establish a fundamental basis for probabilistic design criteria for static friction.},

The method, which directly measures the increase in total fault length with a decrease in ruler size, gives the fractal dimension D and scaling properties for the chosen length band 0.5\textendash 1000 km. A physical interpretation of D is that it measures the irregularity of the fault trace in the selected band. The fault is subdivided into six segments of distinctive seismic behavior. A ``main'' fault trace which shows either maximum coseismic slip or creeping was selected for analysis, with three alternative branches examined for the SAF system south of San Bernardino. Branches of the fault trace are not considered in this work. Fractal dimensions calculated for the different segments range from 1.0008 to 1.0191, and are different from 1.0 to the 95\% confidence interval. These small changes reflect the overall smoothness of the main fault trace. Significant variations in D among segments indicate heterogeneities in the fault smoothness along strike. D also changes significantly from the short-length band to the long-length band where the demarcation point ranges from 1 to 2 km. The short-length band has larger D values. A slight correlation is obtained between the fractal dimension of the main trace and the extent of subparallel faulting. This indicates some correspondence between the main fault trace irregularity and the complexity of subsidiary fault traces in plan view.},

  abstract   = {The mechanical and hydraulic behavior of discontinuities in rock, such as joints and faults, depends strongly on the topography of the contacting surfaces and the degree of correlation between them. Understanding this behavior over the scales of interest in the earth requires knowledge of how topography or roughness varies with surface size. Using two surface profilers, each sensitive to a particular scale of topographic features, we have studied the topography of various natural rock surfaces from wavelengths less than 20 microns to nearly 1 meter. The surfaces studied included fresh natural joints (mode I cracks) in both crystalline and sedimentary rocks, a frictional wear surface formed by glaciation, and a bedding plane surface. There is remarkable similarity among these surfaces. Each surface has a ``red noise'' power spectrum over the entire frequency band studied, with the power falling off on average between 2 and 3 orders of magnitude per decade increase in spatial frequency. This implies a strong increase in rms height with surface size, which has little tendency to level off for wavelengths up to 1 meter. These observations can be interpreted using a fractal model of topography. In this model the scaling of the surface roughness is described by the fractal dimension D. The topography of these natural rock surfaces cannot be described by a single fractal dimension, for this parameter was found to vary significantly with the frequency band considered. This observed inhomogeneity in the scaling parameter implies that extrapolation of roughness to other bands of interest should be done with care. Study of the increase in rms height with profile length for two extreme cases from our data provides an idea of the expected variation in mechanical and hydraulic properties for natural discontinuities in rock. This indicates that in addition to the scaling of topography, the degree of correlation between the contacting surfaces is important to quantify.},

  abstract   = {The physical contact between two rough surfaces is referred to as a ``joint,'' and the deformation of such a joint under normal stress is called the ``joint closure.'' Toward better understanding of joint closure, we present a theory of contact between two random nominally flat elastic surfaces. This theory is a more general form of a theory presented previously by others for the elastic contact of a rough surface and a flat surface. In agreement with the previous theory we show that the joint closure property depends as much on the details of the surface topography as on the elastic properties of the material. To apply these results by using linear surface profiles requires mapping of profile information to three dimensions. The mapping techniques described here require the probability density function for the contacting surfaces to be approximated well by either a Gaussian distribution or an inverted chi-square distribution. Laboratory experiments on ground surfaces of glass samples were done to test the theory. Both joint closure and surface topography were measured. In most cases, experimental results agreed quantitatively with predictions of the theory. However, in experiments on the smoothest surfaces, sample preparation problems often resulted in surfaces with a domed shape. These surfaces did not fit the assumptions of the theory, but the observed deviations from the theory were consistent with this domed shape. Surface topography measurements suggest that many surfaces are statistically similar. This implies that the success of the theory in predicting joint closure does not depend on a particular sample preparation technique. Therefore the theory should be valid for all nominally flat elastic surfaces. The form of the power spectrum implies that the surface topography and thus the joint closure depend on sample size.},

  abstract   = {At high confining pressure the coefficient of friction, {$\mu$}, for granite depends on the relative displacement of the surfaces. For ground surfaces, {$\mu$} reaches a maximum after about 0.1 cm and then decreases to nearly a constant value after 0.5 cm of sliding has occurred. Features on the surfaces after sliding suggest that the maximum is reached when intimate contact is first established. Also, this maximum value is the same as the initial {$\mu$} for perfectly mated rough surfaces. The decrease in {$\mu$} from the maximum is probably caused by rolling on wear particles between the surfaces, {$\mu$} decreases with an increase in normal stress, owing to a finite shear strength at zero pressure of interlocking irregularities on the surfaces. Water reduces the frictional shear strength of granite by about 400 bars, independent of the normal stress across the sliding surfaces. Brittle fracture of surface asperities may be the controlling mechanism during the frictional sliding of brittle materials such as granite. Up to the highest pressures investigated, sliding movement between the surfaces occurred with violent stick-slip. Stick-slip along a pre-existing fault may be a source of crustal earthquakes. The `brittle-ductile' transition pressure in silicate rocks may simply be the pressure at which the frictional shear strength is equal to the fracture shear strength. In the Coulomb theory it is assumed that the strength of a rock is determined by {$\mu$} and the cohesive strength. The theory does not hold for westerly granite. According to the effective stress theory, the stress required for one block of rock to slide on another in the presence of pore fluid of pressure p is given by {$\tau$} = {$\mu$}({$\sigma$}n - p). The theory holds for granite if {$\mu$} is the coefficient of friction for sliding on water-saturated surfaces and if allowances are made for the fact that {$\mu$} may be a function of the effective stress across the surfaces.},

  abstract = {We fit a recently proposed failure criterion to experimental data for fracture and friction strength of various rocks. The criterion rests on the Cardano condition for the existence of three real-valued eigenvalues of the characteristic equation of the stress tensor and specifically addresses the non-linear dependence of fracture and friction on increasing mean stress. The approach provides a theoretical link between macroscopic fracture of a continuum and sliding friction on a pre-existing interface. The criterion rests on three fit parameters whose physical meaning is investigated by fitting previously published data of rocks characterized by differences in composition, porosity, and grain size. In all investigated cases the friction characteristics predicted from the fit of fracture strength data excellently fit independent experimental friction data. Of the three fit parameters, one appears to be determined by the stress concentrations associated with pores and an intrinsic, composition-dependent strength parameter of the constituents, such as mineral-hardness. The second parameter scales inversely with grain size and represents the tensile strength of the polycrystalline aggregates. Mostly owing to the lack of explicit tensile strength or extension data, the third parameter quantifying the pressure-dependence at very low mean stresses remains poorly constrained. It appears affected by composition or the geometric distribution of phases. Fitting macroscopic failure accompanied by pressure-insensitive, crystal plastic deformation mechanisms, such as mechanical twinning in marbles, requires much lower values of the third parameter than purely brittle deformation.},

We demonstrate here that large slow slip events are a cluster of short-duration slow transients. Using a dense catalog of low-frequency earthquakes as a guide, we investigate the Mw 7.5 slow slip event that occurred in 2006 along the subduction interface 40 km beneath Guerrero, Mexico. We show that while the long-period surface displacement, as recorded by Global Positioning System, suggests a 6-month duration, the motion in the direction of tectonic release only sporadically occurs over 55 days, and its surface signature is attenuated by rapid relocking of the plate interface. Our proposed description of slow slip as a cluster of slow transients forces us to re-evaluate our understanding of the physics and scaling of slow earthquakes. A slow slip event is a cluster of small aseismic slip transients intermittently interrupted by relocking of the plate interface.

Source times are determined for 36 large earthquakes during the last three decades. Scaling relations among source times, seismic moments, and fault dimensions are derived. Seismic moment is proportional to the cube of source time, and fault dimension is proportional to source time. Source times for low-angle thrust earthquakes along deep-sea trenches are found to be longer than those of other types, such as intraplate shocks and deep shocks. They are also significantly longer than the rupture times expected from a Haskell model, suggesting that, generally, there exists an introductory stage of faulting that precedes the main stage of the rupture propagation.},

  abstract = {Estimating the likelihood of tsunamis occurring along the U.S. Atlantic coast critically depends on knowledge of tsunami source probability. We review available information on both earthquake and landslide probabilities from potential sources that could generate local and transoceanic tsunamis. Estimating source probability includes defining both size and recurrence distributions for earthquakes and landslides. For the former distribution, source sizes are often distributed according to a truncated or tapered power-law relationship. For the latter distribution, sources are often assumed to occur in time according to a Poisson process, simplifying the way tsunami probabilities from individual sources can be aggregated. For the U.S. Atlantic coast, earthquake tsunami sources primarily occur at transoceanic distances along plate boundary faults. Probabilities for these sources are constrained from previous statistical studies of global seismicity for similar plate boundary types. In contrast, there is presently little information constraining landslide probabilities that may generate local tsunamis. Though there is significant uncertainty in tsunami source probabilities for the Atlantic, results from this study yield a comparative analysis of tsunami source recurrence rates that can form the basis for future probabilistic analyses.},

  abstract = {Determining the likelihood of a disaster is a key component of any comprehensive hazard assessment. This is particularly true for tsunamis, even though most tsunami hazard assessments have in the past relied on scenario or deterministic type models. We discuss probabilistic tsunami hazard analysis (PTHA) from the standpoint of integrating computational methods with empirical analysis of past tsunami runup. PTHA is derived from probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA), with the main difference being that PTHA must account for far-field sources. The computational methods rely on numerical tsunami propagation models rather than empirical attenuation relationships as in PSHA in determining ground motions. Because a number of source parameters affect local tsunami runup height, PTHA can become complex and computationally intensive. Empirical analysis can function in one of two ways, depending on the length and completeness of the tsunami catalog. For site-specific studies where there is sufficient tsunami runup data available, hazard curves can primarily be derived from empirical analysis, with computational methods used to highlight deficiencies in the tsunami catalog. For region-wide analyses and sites where there are little to no tsunami data, a computationally based method such as Monte Carlo simulation is the primary method to establish tsunami hazards. Two case studies that describe how computational and empirical methods can be integrated are presented for Acapulco, Mexico (site-specific) and the U.S. Pacific Northwest coastline (region-wide analysis).},

  abstract = {Fault zones contain structural complexity on all scales. This complexity influences fault mechanics including the dynamics of large earthquakes as well as the spatial and temporal distribution of small seismic events. Incomplete earthquake records, unknown stresses, and unresolved fault structures within the crust complicate a quantitative assessment of the parameters that control factors affecting seismicity. To better understand the relationship between fault structure and seismicity, we examined dynamic faulting under controlled conditions in the laboratory by creating saw-cut-guided natural fractures in cylindrical granite samples. The resulting rough surfaces were triaxially loaded to produce a sequence of stick\textendash slip events. During these experiments, we monitored stress, strain, and seismic activity. After the experiments, fault structures were imaged in thin sections and using computer tomography. The laboratory fault zones showed many structural characteristics observed in upper crustal faults, including zones of localized slip embedded in a layer of fault gouge. Laboratory faults also exhibited a several millimeter wide damage zone with decreasing micro-crack density at larger distances from the fault axis. In addition to the structural similarities, we also observed many similarities between our observed distribution of acoustic emissions (AEs) and natural seismicity. The AEs followed the Gutenberg\textendash Richter and Omori\textendash Utsu relationships commonly used to describe natural seismicity. Moreover, we observed a connection between along-strike fault heterogeneity and variations of the Gutenberg\textendash Richter b value. As suggested by natural seismicity studies, areas of low b value marked the nucleation points of large slip events and were located at large asperities within the fault zone that were revealed by post-experimental tomography scans. Our results emphasize the importance of stick\textendash slip experiments for the study of fault mechanics. The direct correlation of acoustic activity with fault zone structure is a unique characteristic of our laboratory studies that has been impossible to observe in nature.},

The prevailing interpretation of M0-T observations proposes different scaling for fast (earthquakes) and slow (mostly aseismic) slip populations and thus fundamentally different driving mechanisms. We show that a single model of slip events within bounded slip zones may explain nearly all fast and slow slip M0-T observations, and both slip populations have a change in scaling, where the slip area growth changes from 2-D when too small to sense the boundaries to 1-D when large enough to be bounded. We present new fast and slow slip M0-T observations that sample the change in scaling in each population, which are consistent with our interpretation. We suggest that a continuous but bimodal distribution of slip modes exists and M0-T observations alone may not imply a fundamental difference between fast and slow slip.},

Simulation experiments show that the Karnopp model, the Dahl model, and the new models give similar results in two examples.

  abstract   = {Source time functions of 255 moderate to great earthquakes obtained from inversions of teleseismic body waves by Tanioka and Ruff [1997] and coworkers were compared in a systematic way. They were scaled to remove the effect of moment and to allow the direct comparison and averaging of time function shape as well as duration. Time function durations picked by Tanioka and Ruff [1997] are proportional to the cube root of seismic moment if moments from the Harvard centroid moment tensor catalog are used. The average duration of scaled time functions is shorter and the average shape has a more abrupt termination for deeper events than shallower ones, with a distinct change occurring at {$\sim$}40 km depth. The complexity of the time functions, as quantified by the number of subevents, appears to decrease below {$\sim$}40 km depth. Furthermore, among events shallower than 40 km, the average duration of scaled time functions is shorter, and their average shape has a more abrupt termination (1) for events with strike-slip focal mechanisms compared to thrust events and (2) for the few thrust events associated with an intraplate setting compared to the majority associated with an interplate (subduction) boundary. In each of these cases, events in more technically and seismically active settings have a longer duration and a more gradual termination. This can be interpreted in terms of lower stress drops and/or slower rupture velocities at active plate boundaries, suggesting that fault rheology depends on slip rate and may evolve as total fault slip accumulates. Furthermore, differences in average time function shape and duration associated with different subduction zones suggest that differences exist in the rheology on the plate boundaries at the various subduction zones.

This paper presents a simple model of slow earthquakes that can explain wide variety of observed features including the steady moment rate and scaled energy, characteristics of tremor signals both in time and frequency domains, and the migration of the source location. In this model, slow earthquakes are represented as shear slip on circular faults whose radius is a random variable that is governed by a Langevin equation and three parameters, a diffusion coefficient, a damping coefficient, and a slip rate coefficient. This model expands on a previous scaling law for the slow earthquakes by providing a specific image of kinematics. Allowing for spatial variations of the parameters could potentially explain differences in behavior of slow slip events worldwide.},

Each of these has been demonstrated to arise from shear slip, just as do regular earthquakes, but with longer characteristic durations and radiating much less seismic energy. Here we show that these slow events follow a simple, unified scaling relationship that clearly differentiates their behaviour from that of regular earthquakes. We find that their seismic moment is proportional to the characteristic duration and their moment rate function is constant, with a spectral high-frequency decay of f-1. This scaling and spectral behaviour demonstrates that they can be thought of as different manifestations of the same phenomena and that they comprise a new earthquake category. The observed scale dependence of rupture velocity for these events can be explained by either a constant low-stress drop model or a diffusional constant-slip model. This new scaling law unifies a diverse class of slow seismic events and may lead to a better understanding of the plate subduction process and large earthquake generation.},

  abstract = {Slow tectonic events, such as deep tectonic tremor, low-frequency earthquakes, very low frequency earthquakes, and slow slip events, are regarded as ``broadband slow earthquakes''. Various observational properties of these events have previously been explained using a one-dimensional (1D) stochastic model that mimics Brownian motion in the time domain. Here we present a simple two-dimensional (2D) slow earthquake model using a probabilistic cell automaton (PCA), where each cell possesses one of two states (slip or hold) at a given time step. The status of each cell is updated as a Markov process dependent on its own status and that of neighboring cells. The seismic moment rate of the event in the 2D PCA model is assumed to be proportional to the number of slipping cells, which is approximated using a stochastic differential equation equivalent to the previous 1D Brownian model approach. This 2D PCA model is, therefore, able to explain the various observational properties of slow earthquakes. Moreover, it includes an additional degree of freedom to separate the effects of loading and dissipation, which enables us to explain the variations in episodic slow slip activity. The size of the slow earthquake is limited by either the system size or the characteristic size, which is controlled by the degree of dissipation. Such a simple representation of slow earthquakes is useful for characterizing the broad spectrum of slow earthquake behavior in different environments.},

Second, available literature on the continuous nonlinear theory is quite esoteric and controversial, and thus inaccessible to engineers uninitiated in measure theory and stochastic differential equations. Furthermore, it is not clear from the available literature whether the nonlinear theory can be applied to practical engineering problems. In attempting to fill the stated needs, the author has retained as much mathematical rigor as he felt was consistent with the prime objective\textemdash to explain the theory to engineers. Thus, the author has avoided measure theory in this book by using mean square convergence, on the premise that everyone knows how to average.

  abstract = {The answer to the above question depends on the definition of earthquake prediction. We discuss several definitions and possible classifications of earthquake prediction methods. We also consider various measures of prediction efficiency, review several recent examples of earthquake prediction, and describe the methods that can be used to verify prediction schemes. We conclude that an empirical search for earthquake precursors that forecast the size of an impending earthquake has been fruitless. Despite considerable effort in several countries, no statistically rigorous validation of proposed precursory phenomena is available: therefore, reported cases of precursors can be explained by random noise or by chance coincidence. We present evidence that earthquakes are non-linear, chaotic, scale-invariant phenomena. The most probable consequence of earthquake self-similarity is a lack of earthquake predictability as popularly defined, that is a forecast of a specific individual earthquake. Many small earthquakes occur throughout any seismic zone, demonstrating that the critical conditions for earthquake nucleation are satisfied almost everywhere. Apparently, any small shock can grow into a large event. Thus, it is likely that an earthquake has no preparatory stage. This sceptical view of current earthquake prediction efforts should not be interpreted as a statement that any further attempts to mitigate the destructive effects of earthquakes are futile. The seismic-moment conservation principle, when combined with geodetic deformation data, offers a new way to evaluate the seismic hazard, not only for tectonic plate boundaries, but also for areas of low seismicity, that is the interiors of continents. Earthquake clustering with a power-law temporal decay (Omori's law) can be used to estimate the rate of future earthquake ocurrence. Realtime seismology can facilitate relief efforts after large earthquakes and eventually provide an immediate warning of severe shaking a few seconds or tens of seconds before the shaking starts.},

(2) The seismic moment was 2.6 \texttimes{} 1027 dyn cm. The directivity of the surface wave radiation indicates an asymmetric (1:2.3) bilateral faulting with a total length of 250 km. In modeling the displacement a rupture velocity of 3 km/s was used, and the fault curvature was included. (3) If a fault width of 15 km is assumed, the average offset is estimated to be about 2 m. This value is about twice as large as the average surface offset. (4) Although the observed directivity suggests a uniform overall displacement along the fault, the body wave analysis suggests that the earthquake consists of as many as 10 independent events, each having a seismic moment of 1.3\textendash 5.3 \texttimes{} 1026 dyn cm and a fault length of about 10 km. The spatial separation of these events varies from 14 to 40 km. This multiple-shock sequence suggests that the rupture propagation is jagged and partially incoherent with an average velocity of 2 km/s. (5) The average stress drop estimated from surface waves is about 30 bars, but the local stress drop for the individual events may be significantly higher than this. (6) The complex multiple event is a manifestation of a heterogeneous distribution of the mechanical properties along the fault, which may be caused by either asperities, differences in strength, differences in pore pressure, differences in slip characteristics (stable sliding versus stick slip), or combinations of these factors. (7) This complexity has important bearing on the state of stress along transform faults and is important in assessing the effect of large earthquakes along other transform faults like the San Andreas.

Kaproth and Marone (p. 1229; published online 15 August) have made laboratory observations of repetitive, slow stick-slip in fault-zone materials and developed a mechanical explanation for how earthquake-like dynamic slip nucleation could start and then arrest so as to produce slow slip. As preseismic slip is a precursor to rupture, temporal variations in elastic wave speeds should be monitored in regions of high seismic hazard. Earthquakes normally occur as frictional stick-slip instabilities, resulting in catastrophic failure and seismic rupture. Tectonic faults also fail in slow earthquakes with rupture durations of months or more, yet their origin is poorly understood. Here, we present laboratory observations of repetitive, slow stick-slip in serpentinite fault zones and mechanical evidence for their origin. We document a transition from unstable to stable frictional behavior with increasing slip velocity, providing a mechanism to limit the speed of slow earthquakes. We also document reduction of P-wave speed within the active shear zone before stick-slip events. If similar mechanisms operate in nature, our results suggest that higher-resolution studies of elastic properties in tectonic fault zones may aid in the search for reliable earthquake precursors. Slip-stick experiments reveal the evolution of frictional behavior during slow earthquakes. Slip-stick experiments reveal the evolution of frictional behavior during slow earthquakes.},

  abstract = {Finite-fault source inversions reveal the spatial complexity of earthquake slip or pre-stress distribution over the fault surface. The basic assumption of this study is that a stochastic model can reproduce the variability in amplitude and the long-range correlation of the spatial slip distribution. In this paper, we compute the stochastic model for the source models of four earthquakes: the 1979 Imperial Valley, the 1989 Loma Prieta, the 1994 Northridge and 1995 Hyogo-ken Nanbu (Kobe). For each earthquake (except Imperial Valley), we consider both the dip and strike slip distributions. In each case, we use a 1-D stochastic model. For the four earthquakes, we show that the average power spectra of the raw, that is, non-interpolated, data follow a power-law behaviour with scaling exponents that range from 0.78 to 1.71. For the four earthquakes, we have found that a non-Gaussian probability law, that is, the L\'evy law, is better suited to reproduce the main features of the spatial variability embedded in the slip amplitude distribution, including the presence and frequency of large fluctuations. Since asperities are usually defined as regions with large slip values on the fault, the stochastic model will allow predicting and modelling the spatial distribution of the asperities over the fault surface. The values of the L\'evy parameters differ from one earthquake to the other. Assuming an isotropic spatial distribution of heterogeneity for the dip and the strike slip of he Northridge earthquake, we also compute a 2-D stochastic model. The main conclusions reached in the 1-D analysis remain appropriate for the 2-D model. The results obtained for the four earthquakes suggest that some features of the slip spatial complexity are universal and can be modelled accordingly. If this is proven correct, this will imply that the spatial variability and the long-range correlation of the slip or pre-stress spatial distribution can be described with the help of five parameters: a scaling exponent controlling the spatial correlation and the four parameters of the L\'evy distribution constraining the spatial variability.},

  abstract = {The spatial fractal dimension D of earthquakes (or faults) is often correlated with the slope b of the Gutenberg-Richter law, independently of earthquake size. An already classical formula is Aki's D = 3b/c = 2b. This formula implies the three following hypothesis: (1) the Gutenberg-Richter law log10N = a - bM is satisfied; (2) the seismic moment M0 is related to the surface magnitude Ms as log10M0 = cMs + d with a typical value of c = 1.5; and (3) the static self-similarity scaling law is satisfied, that is, M0 {$\propto$} L3, where L is the characteristic dimension of the fault.Hypothesis (3) implies that events are small or intermediate and break on a square plane (i.e., M0 {$\propto$} L3). Nevertheless, for large events, this hypothesis is not satisfied because the shape of large events is a rectangle and not a square (i.e., M0 {$\propto$} L2). Therefore, for large events the formula D = 3b/c should not be used; the formula D = 2b/c should be used instead.In hypothesis (2), c depends upon event sizes: c = 1, 1.5, and 2 for small, intermediate, and large events, respectively, therefore resulting in D = 3b, D = 2b, and D = b, respectively. As a consequence, small earthquakes (or small faults) are distributed within volumes, whereas large earthquakes (or large faults) are distributed along lines.},

It represents the physical reality for some practical application cases but does not accurately represent the friction phenomenon of a general contact between two 3D objects because the friction force vector is possibly rotating in the time-varying common tangential plane of the contacting surfaces. In this research the original integrated bristle friction model is extended to a 3-dimensional model. With such an extension, the resulting friction force model can be used to compute friction forces in both sticking and sliding regimes for general contact dynamics modeling. Simulation examples are presented to demonstrate the application of the model. Experiments were designed and performed to validate the new model. The presented validation exercise demonstrated that the extended bristle friction model can well duplicate experimental results including typical frictional behaviors such as sliding, sticking and stick-slip.},

We develop a stochastic characterization of earthquake slip complexity, based on published finite-source rupture models, in which we model the distribution of slip as a spatial random field. The model most consistent with the data follows a von Karman autocorrelation function (ACF) for which the correlation lengths a increase with source dimension. For earthquakes with large fault aspect ratios, we observe substantial differences of the correlation length in the along-strike (ax) and downdip (az) directions. Increasing correlation length with increasing magnitude can be understood using concepts of dynamic rupture propagation. The power spectrum of the slip distribution can also be well described with a power law decay (i.e., a fractal distribution) in which the fractal dimension D remains scale invariant, with a median value D = 2.29 {$\pm$} 0.23, while the corner wave number kc, which is inversely proportional to source size, decreases with earthquake magnitude, accounting for larger ``slip patches'' for large-magnitude events. Our stochastic slip model can be used to generate realizations of scenario earthquakes for near-source ground motion simulations.},

  abstract = {As an alternative to spectral methods, stochastic self-similar slip can be produced through a composite source model by placing a power-law scaling size-frequency distribution of circular slip dislocations on a fault surface. However these models do not accurately account for observed surface rupture behaviour. We propose a modification to the composite source model that corrects this issue. The advantage of this technique is that it accommodates the use of fractal slip distributions on non-planar fault surfaces. However to mimic a surface rupture using this technique, releasing the boundary condition at the top of the fault, we observed a systematic decrease in slip at shallow depths. We propose a new strategy whereby the surface is treated like a reflector with the slip being folded back onto the fault. Two different techniques based on this principal are presented: the first is the method of images. It requires a small change to pre-existing codes and works for planar faults. The second involves the use of a multistage trilateration technique. It is applied to non-planar faults described by an unstructured mesh. The reflected slip calculated using the two techniques is near identical on a planar fault, suggesting they are equivalent. Applying this correction, where reflected slip is accounted for in the composite source model, the lack of slip at shallow depths is not observed any more and there is no systematic trend with depth. However, there are other parameters which may affect the spatial distribution of slip across the fault plane. For example, the type of probability density function used in the placement of the subevent is also important. In the case where the location of maximum slip is known to a first order, a Gaussian may be appropriate to describe the probability function. For hazard assessment studies a uniform probability density function is more suitable as it provides no underlying systematic spatial trend.},

  abstract = {This paper first reviews recent studies on constitutive formulations for shear failure, which leads to the conclusion that revealing the constitutive property for not only frictional slip failure, but also shear failure of intact rock in the brittle to brittle-plastic transition regimes is critical to establish the constitutive law which governs earthquake shear failure that proceeds in the lithosphere. To this end, a unique, high stiffness testing apparatus capable of applying polyaxial stress fields to rectangular rock specimens, has been constructed, for which a brief description is given. The paper then presents new results of laboratory experiments on constitutive properties of shear fracture of intact granite at lithospheric conditions. In view of the physical principles and constraints to be imposed on the constitutive law for shear failure, the slip-dependency is a more fundamental property than the time- or rate-dependency, and hence the constitutive law for shear failure should primarily be slip-dependent. This slip-dependent constitutive law, which itself is self-consistent, can unifyingly and quantitatively treat the entire phases from stable, quasistatic ruture growth to unstable, dynamic fast-speed rupture propagation for shear failure of any type, whether it is frictional slip failure along a preexisting fault or shear fracture of intact materials. The slip-dependent constitutive law includes a scaling parameter Dc (critical slip displacement) explicitly, which in turn is scaled by a characteristic length {$\lambda$}c representing geometrical irregularities of the fault surfaces. Incorporation of Dc (or {$\lambda$}c) enables this constitutive law to provide a common interpretation for shear failure of any size scale as an earthquake source, from small scale in the laboratory to large scale in the Earth. The present experiments corroborate the slip-dependent constitutive relation and other constitutive properties over the entire process from slip-strengthening to slip-weakening of intact granite, under the conditions that confining pressure is in the range 440 to 500 MPa, pore pressure is in the range 30 to 300 MPa, temperature is in the range from room temperature to 456\textdegree C, and strain rate is in the range 10-4 to 10-7/s. It is found that some constitutive law parameters are not independent, but mutually related. The constitutive relation for shear failure and the parameters such as {$\Delta\tau$}p (breakdown stress drop) and Dc prescribing its relation, are affected by ambient conditions such as temperature and strain rate.},

Noting that the earthquake rupture is a mixed process between frictional slip failure and the shear fracture of intact rock, it is concluded that the constitutive law for the earthquake rupture be formulated as a unifying law that governs both frictional slip failure and shear fracture of intact rock. It is demonstrated that the slip-dependent constitutive law is such a unifying law, and a constitutive scaling law is derived from laboratory data on both frictional slip failure and shear fracture of intact rock.

Stick-slip was generated along a 40 cm long precut fault in Tsukuba granite samples using a servocontrolled biaxial loading apparatus. The displacement-time function or the slip velocity-time function depends upon an applied normal stress. The frequency content of the elastic waves depends on normal stress; higher-frequency components are generated during stick-slip failure at higher normal stress. A physical explanation for this is given in terms of asperities where sliding surfaces make contact. The cutoff frequency fc originating from slip instability along the fault is related to v/{$<$}li{$>$} (v rupture velocity, {$<$}li{$>$} average distance between two adjacent asperities), and fc can be estimated from the slip velocity power spectra. Interrelations between shear stress {$\tau$}, displacement and slip velocity V near a tip of the propagating slip zone were investigated to reveal dynamic breakdown processes, during which the strength can degrade regardless of V. Slip failure instability is promoted during the phase d{$\tau$}/dt{$<$}0 and dV/dt{$>$}0, and stability during the phase dV/dt{$<$}0 regardless of d{$\tau$}/dt. At a high normal stress, a number of cycles of accelerating and decelerating phases are repeated during a slip failure, showing that the breakdown of local asperities on the slipping surfaces occurs successively during the slip failure.},

In addition, the experiments provide insights into important length-scaling effects that are useful for assessing concepts such as critical crack length or rupture nucleation dimension. Stick-slip shear failures have been generated along a 2-m-long simulated fault in a block of Sierra white granite. Experiments were conducted at normal stresses between 0.6 and 4 MPa with two different prepared roughnesses of the simulated fault: a smooth fault with a profilometer measured roughness of 0.2 {$\mu$}m and a rough fault with a measured roughness of {$\sim$}80 {$\mu$}m. High-speed records of shear strains and slip velocities clearly show both the propagation of the stick-slip failures and details of the local deformations and motions from which slip weakening of the fault at the onset of sliding can be resolved. Both the dynamic stress drops of the stick-slip events and the apparent fracture energies of the events determined from the records of the fault slip weakening increase with increasing normal stress. Although critical slip-weakening displacements are insensitive to normal stress, they increase with increased fault roughness such that the apparent fracture energies are also larger on the rough fault than on the smooth fault. Slip velocities in these experiments are influenced by roughness and are proportional to stress drop. Although the onset of slip is sharply defined, the termination of slip is more gradual without a clear stopping phase. Measured rupture velocities on the rough fault are lower than those on the smooth fault. When a length scale based on rupture nucleation dimensions, directly proportional to critical displacements, is introduced, the data suggest that at fault lengths close to the nucleation lengths, rupture velocity and slip velocity increase with increasing fault length.},

The model is a specific form of the barrier model proposed by Aki et al. (1977). According to this specific barrier model, the fault surface is visualized as composed of an aggregate of circular cracks which represent areas of localized slip, and the strong motion is assumed to be generated by the stationary occurrence of these localized ruptures as the rupture front propagates. The acceleration power spectra of direct S waves are described by their peak value P0 and an effective bandwidth {$\Delta$}f. P0 scales proportionally to the width of the causative fault and to the square of local stress drop which is proportional to the ratio of maximum slip over the barrier interval. {$\Delta$}f is specified by the corner frequency and a cutoff frequency which presumably originates from fault nonelasticity and is considered to be inversely proportional to the cohesive zone size. From these spectra and an estimate of the duration of faulting, measures of strong motion intensity such as rms and maximum acceleration can be inferred. Results of the application of the model to strong motion observations of various events are reported in Part II.},

  abstract   = {This book presents various results and techniques from the theory of stochastic processes that are useful in the study of stochastic problems in the natural sciences. The main focus is analytical methods, although numerical methods and statistical inference methodologies for studying diffusion processes are also presented. The goal is the development of techniques that are applicable to a wide variety of stochastic models that appear in physics, chemistry and other natural sciences. Applications such as stochastic resonance, Brownian motion in periodic potentials and Brownian motors are studied and the connection between diffusion processes and time-dependent statistical mechanics is elucidated.The book contains a large number of illustrations, examples, and exercises. It will be useful for graduate-level courses on stochastic processes for students in applied mathematics, physics and engineering. Many of the topics covered in this book (reversible diffusions, convergence to equilibrium for diffusion processes, inference methods for stochastic differential equations, derivation of the generalized Langevin equation, exit time problems) cannot be easily found in textbook form and will be useful to both researchers and students interested in the applications of stochastic processes.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a finite element calculation of frictionless, non-adhesive, contact between a rigid plane and an elasto-plastic solid with a self-affine fractal surface. The calculations are conducted within an explicit dynamic Lagrangian framework. The elasto-plastic response of the material is described by a J2 isotropic plasticity law. Parametric studies are used to establish general relations between contact properties and key material parameters. In all cases, the contact area A rises linearly with the applied load. The rate of increase grows as the yield stress {$\sigma$}y decreases, scaling as a power of {$\sigma$}y over the range typical of real materials. Results for A from different plasticity laws and surface morphologies can all be described by a simple scaling formula. Plasticity produces qualitative changes in the distributions of local pressures in the contact and of the size of connected contact regions. The probability of large local pressures is decreased, while large clusters become more likely. Loading-unloading cycles are considered and the total plastic work is found to be nearly constant over a wide range of yield stresses.},

  abstract   = {Fault slip surfaces and earthquake surface ruptures are not flat but show corrugations at all scales, also called roughness. These corrugations control the distribution of stress and strength on the fault plane and around. Here, we review the scaling properties of faults and earthquake slip roughness. Interestingly, both fault and earthquake datasets show power-law geometrical properties with similar scaling exponents, which indicate the existence of long-range spatial correlations. Several mechanisms are identified that control fault roughness, such as wear during slip and growth of a fault, by linking shear fracture segments. Scaling exponents are also found in numerical models where a rupture propagates into an elastic medium that contains mechanical heterogeneities: the roughness scaling emerges from the long-range elastic interactions and the pinning of the slip front by heterogeneities. Finally, several questions remain open on the effect of roughness on fault slip and could be the topic of future studies: (i) Is aseismic slip controlled by roughness? (ii) Is small scale-roughness (below millimeter scale) different from larger scale roughness and how does it record processes occurring during dynamic rupture and/or during fault healing? (iii) How do plastic and elastic processes interact to modify roughness and faulting?},

  abstract   = {The complex geometry of faults, seismicity, and diversity of earthquake mechanisms suggest that the stress and strength in Earth's crust are spatially heterogeneous. We investigated the degree of heterogeneity using the following two end-member models. In one end-member model, we assumed that the orientation of stress is uniform in the crust as is assumed in many stress inversion studies. In this model, the variability of earthquake mechanisms means that friction during faulting must vary for each event. We computed friction {$\mu$} from the ratio of the resolved shear stress to the effective normal stress on the fault plane with the assumption of hydrostatic pore pressure. The values of {$\mu$} vary over a large range from 0 to 1.5. In the other extreme model we assumed optimally oriented slip and a constant {$\mu$} = 0.6, as is suggested by Byerlee's law, for all the earthquakes, and determined the local stress orientation for each earthquake. The orientation of the stress changes drastically from one earthquake to another, and the assumption of uniform stress field commonly used in stress inversion is not warranted. An important conclusion is that a regionally uniform stress field and constant friction on optimally oriented faults are mutually exclusive. The actual situation in the crust is most likely to be intermediate between these two end-member models. From the existing data alone, we cannot determine the degree of heterogeneity uniquely, but both {$\mu$} and the local stress field near earthquake faults are likely to vary substantially, and studies on earthquake rupture dynamics must take these heterogeneities into consideration.},

The state variables are defined macroscopically by evolution equations for their rates of change in terms of their present values and slip rate. Experiments may strongly suggest that one state variable is adequate or prove that one is inadequate. Analysis of steady slip governed by a single state variable in a spring and (massless) slider predict oscillations at a critical spring stiffness k = kcrit. The critical stiffness kcrit is given by a simple formula and steady slip is stable for k {$>$} kcrit and unstable for k {$<$} kcrit. State variable friction laws may superficially appear as a simple slip rate dependence, slip distance dependence, or time dependent static friction, depending on experiment and testing machinery. Truly complicated motion is possible in a spring-slider model if more than one state variable is used. Further consequences of state variable friction laws can include creep waves and apparent rate independence for some phenomena.},

In addition, many aspects of regional seismicity appear to be stochastic both in space and time. However, within this complexity, there is considerable self-organization. We argue that the occurrence of earthquakes is a problem that can be attacked using the fundamentals of statistical physics. Concepts of statistical physics associated with phase changes and critical points have been successfully applied to a variety of cellular automata models. Examples include sandpile models, forest fire models, and, particularly, slider block models. These models exhibit avalanche behavior very similar to observed seismicity. A fundamental question is whether variations in seismicity can be used to successfully forecast the occurrence of earthquakes. Several attempts have been made to utilize precursory seismic activation and quiescence to make earthquake forecasts, some of which show promise.},

Laboratory evidence suggests that these properties can be measured in active seismic surveys, potentially offering a route to characterizing friction in situ. We present experimental results from a subresonance torsional modulus and attenuation apparatus that utilizes micron-scale sinusoidal oscillations to probe the nonlinear stress-strain relation at a range of strain amplitudes and rates. Nonlinear effects are further quantified using harmonic distortion; however, time series data best illuminate underlying physical processes. The low-frequency stress-strain hysteretic loops show stiffening at the sinusoid's static ends, but stiffening is reduced above a threshold frequency. This shape is determined by harmonic generation in the strain; the stress signal has no harmonics, confirming that the fractured sample is the source of the nonlinearity. These qualitative observations suggest the presence of rate-dependent friction and are consistent between fractures in three different rock types. We propose that static friction at the low strain rate part of the cycle, when given sufficient ?healing? time at low oscillation frequencies, causes this stiffening cusp shape in the hysteresis loop. While rate-and-state friction is commonly used to represent dynamic friction, it cannot capture static friction or negative slip velocities. So we implement another dynamic friction model, based on the work of Dahl, which describes this process and produces similar results. Since the two models have a similar form, parameterizations of field data could constraint fault model inputs, such as specific location velocity strengthening or weakening properties.},

  abstract   = {The topography of natural faults and fractures has been measured over nearly the entire band: 105 M to 10-5 M. It is found that the surfaces are fractal or nearly fractal over this entire band but that the fractal dimension, D, is a function of spatial frequency. Both abrupt and gradual transitions in D are observed and over some scales, most notably at the high and low ends of the spectral band studied, the surfaces are smooth enough to be differentiable, i.e., they are Euclidean. From these results we can deduce that the asperity distribution on faults obeys an inverse power law and that fault roughness scales with spatial wavelength. The constants in these relationships, however, depend on D, and hence hold over only limited spatial bands. On the scale of frictional sliding during an earthquake, rms roughness and asperity size scale up with slip, so that in slip-weakening models of the stick-slip instability the critical distance, dc, will also be expected to scale with slip and hence earthquake size. As a result, the energy release rate G can also be expected to increase with rupture size and slip weakening models in which dc is a fixed parameter may not be realistic. At longer wavelengths, the fractal nature of fault geometry provides a simple explanation for the randomness of strong ground motions and of the size distributions of earthquakes and faults. That large and small earthquakes belong to different hierarchies of size distributions is consistent with their different scaling relations.},

The earthquake event was recorded by 66 strong ground-motion stations operated by the China Strong Motion Networks Center. We simulated 11 records selected within 200~km source-to-site distance. According to previous studies and empirical relationships, we estimated the region-specific input parameters. The zero-distance kappa filter obtained had a value of 0.0206~s. Two different source models were applied in this study: the random slip model and specified slip model. Using the stochastic finite-fault method, we simulated the PGA, Fourier spectrum and response spectrum at all stations. The stochastic simulated result based on the specified slip distribution models had no significant bias at most stations. Using a model with a random slip distribution, the simulated response spectra also matched the observed result, which indicated that the stochastic finite-fault method is not very sensitive to the input slip distributions and fault dimensions. We divided the study area into 1116 sites to simulate the spatial distribution of PGA based on the two models. The simulated maximum intensity of the epicentral area reached level IX, which was similar to the observed maximum intensity and indicated that the simulated result could be used in prediction of an imminent earthquake disaster. For future earthquake prediction, seismic hazards could even be estimated quickly without obtaining detailed information about the fault plane.},

In this study, we analyze the probability distribution of coseismic slip, which provides important information to better understand earthquake source physics. Although the probability distribution of slip is crucial for generating realistic rupture scenarios for simulation-based seismic and tsunami-hazard analysis, the statistical properties of earthquake slip have received limited attention so far. Here, we use the online database of earthquake source models (SRCMOD) to show that the probability distribution of slip follows the truncated exponential law. This law agrees with rupture-specific physical constraints limiting the maximum possible slip on the fault, similar to physical constraints on maximum earthquake magnitudes. We show the parameters of the best-fitting truncated exponential distribution scale with average coseismic slip. This scaling property reflects the control of the underlying stress distribution and fault strength on the rupture dimensions, which determines the average slip. Thus, the scale-dependent behavior of slip heterogeneity is captured by the probability distribution of slip. We conclude that the truncated exponential law accurately quantifies coseismic slip distribution and therefore allows for more realistic modeling of rupture scenarios.

Here, we introduce a minimal one-dimensional Burridge-Knopoff model which contains slow, subshear, and supershear rupture and demonstrate that different power law exponents occur because the rupture speed of slow events contains long-lived transients. Our findings suggest that there exists a continuum of slip modes between the slow and fast slip end-members but that the natural selection of stress on faults can cause less frequent events in the intermediate range. We find that slow events on one-dimensional faults follow with transition to for longer systems or larger prestress, while the subshear events follow . The model also predicts a supershear scaling relation . Under the assumption of radial symmetry, the generalization to two-dimensional fault planes compares well with observations.},

However, even when amended with heterogeneous rupture, the model fails to explain observations of different sized repeating earthquakes and has challenges explaining high-frequency radiation patterns. We propose an additional cause for high-frequency earthquake spectra from elastic collisions of structures within a rupturing fault zone. The collision spectrum is set by an impact contact time proportional to the size of colliding structures so that spectra depend on fundamentally different physical parameters compared with slip models. When added to standard models, collisions can reconcile the discrepant observations since the size, shape, and orientation of structures vary between different fault zones but remain constant within a fault segment. High-frequency earthquake ground motions and damage may therefore be an outgrowth of fault-zone structure rather than sudden initiation of slip.},

This method allows one to conclude that:(1)|The fracture systems seen on two-dimensional surfaces in granites are consistent with the part of fractal theory that predicts a repetition of patterns on different scales of observation, self similarity. Fractal analysis gives essentially the same values of D on the scale of kilometres, metres and centimetres (five orders of magnitude) using mapped, surface fracture patterns in a Sierra Nevada granite batholith (Mt. Abbot quadrangle, Calif.).(2)|Fractures show the same fractal values at different depths in a given batholith. Mapped fractures (main stage ore veins) at three mining levels (over a 700 m depth interval) of the Boulder batholith, Butte, Mont. show the same fractal values although the fracture disposition appears to be different at different levels.(3)|Different sets of fracture planes in a granite batholith, Central France, and in experimental deformation can have different fractal values. In these examples shear and tension modes have the same fractal values while compressional fractures follow a different fractal mode of failure. The composite fracture patterns are also fractal but with a different, median, fractal value compared to the individual values for the fracture plane sets. These observations indicate that the fractal method can possibly be used to distinguish fractures of different origins in a complex system. It is concluded that granites fracture in a fractal manner which can be followed at many scales. It appears that fracture planes of different origins can be characterized using linear fractal analysis.},

  abstract = {In this review paper, the theoretical and observational studies of scaling of earthquake source displacement spectra (abbreviated as source spectra) are compiled and discussed. The earlier studies, including the kinetic models proposed by several authors [including Haskell (Bull Seismol Soc Am 56:125\textendash 140, 1966) and Aki (J Geophys Res 72:1217\textendash 1231, 1967), provided the so-called {$\omega-$}1, {$\omega$}-square, and {$\omega$}-cube models. Aki (1967) favored the {$\omega$}-square model and also assumed constant stress drop, {$\Delta\sigma$}, and self-similarity of earthquakes. Some observations agree to one of the two models, but others do not. Hence, numerous alternative forms of the three scaling models to interpret the observations have been made by seismologists. For the corner frequencies, fc, the seismic moment Mo scales with fc in the form of Mo\,\textasciitilde\,fc-3. For fcP of the P-waves and fcS of the S-waves, fcP\,{$>$}\,fcS is more reasonable than fcP\,{$<$}\,fcS. Mo scales as TD3, where TD is the duration time of source rupture and inversely related to fc, for both small and large events. The second corner frequency or cut-off frequency, fmax, at higher {$\omega$}, that exists in the source spectra could be yielded by source, path, and site effects. The mechanisms to cause the patch corner frequency are still open. Analytical and numerical studies of the scaling laws based on the dislocation (e.g., Aki 1967), cracks (e.g., Walter and Brune in J Geophys Res 98(B3):4449\textendash 4459, 1993), spring-slider (e.g., Shaw in Geophys Res Lett 20:643\textendash 646, 1993), and statistical physics models (e.g., Hanks in J Geophys Res 84:2235\textendash 2242, 1997), including self-organized criticality (e.g., Bak et al. in Phys Rev Lett 59:381\textendash 384, 1987), show different scaling laws under various physical conditions.},

General friction modelling of the phenomena accompanying dry friction and a simple yet effective approach to capture the hysteretic effect are proposed. Finally, the experimental results are compared with the numerical simulations for the proposed friction model.},

A fracture criterion describes the conditions for which failure occurs in a material. In principle, one distinguishes between phenomenological and mechanistic failure theories. Phenomenological theories (Coulomb, Coulomb-Mohr, Mohr or Hoek-Brown) quantify the spatial orientation of fracture planes with respect to the stress field producing the discontinuities. Mechanistic theories (Griffith, McClintock \& Walsh, fracture mechanics models) start from the premise that fracture initiates from existing flaws acting as stress concentrators through which the brittle fracture process in rock is controlled. Both theories are used to determine the stress state in the Earth's crust and to evaluate the stresses for some of the stress measurement techniques.},
