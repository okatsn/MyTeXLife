  abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) is a significant factor in the climate system. The accurate determination of SM has high importance in food production to satisfy the increasing demand for food and the chemical processes of soil. This paper applies decision tree regression to estimate SM considering different parameters including air temperature, time, relative humidity, and soil temperature. The presented method holds a mighty advantage to determine SM since the stimulant of the decision tree regression is an algorithm that generates a decision tree from given instances. Besides, usage of decision tree regression provides an opportunity to save time. Numerical results show that the presented method offers a high coefficient of determination value (R2), low mean squared error (MSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). The depth of the decision tree equals to five by providing higher fitness values than other depth levels. The best fitness values in the training stage are 0.00019, 0.007, and 0.842 for MSE, MAE, and~R2, respectively. In conclusion of the paper, applied decision tree regression can handle the data of SM estimation in satisfying fitness criterion.},

  abstract = {Soil water content is a key parameter for representing water dynamics in soils. Its prediction is fundamental for different practical applications, such as identifying shallow landslides triggering. Support vector machine (SVM) is a machine learning technique, which can be used to predict the temporal trend of a quantity since training from past data. SVM was applied to a test slope of Oltrep\`o Pavese (northern Italy), where meteorological parameters coupled with soil water content at different depths (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4 m) were measured. Two SVM models were developed for water content assessment: (i) model 1, considering rainfall amount, air temperature, air humidity, net solar radiation, and wind speed; (ii) model 2, considering the same predictors of model 1 together with antecedent condition parameters (cumulated rainfall of 7, 30, and 60 days; mean air temperature of 7, 30, and 60 days). SVM model 2 showed significantly higher satisfactory results than model 1, for both training and test phases and for all the considered soil levels. SVM models trends were implemented in a methodology of slope safety factor assessment. For a real event occurred in the tested slope, the triggering time was correctly predicted using data estimated by SVM model based on antecedent meteorological conditions. This confirms the necessity of including these predictors for building a SVM technique able to estimate correctly soil moisture dynamics in time. The results of this paper show a promising potential application of the SVM methodologies for modeling soil moisture required in slope stability analysis.},

  abstract = {Quantifying the spatial and temporal dynamics of soil moisture is an important subject in vadose zone hydrology. A 1282-day field study was conducted to provide a hierarchy of data to assess neural network simulations of field soil water content time series \texttheta (t). Volumetric water content was determined, typically once a week, by neutron thermalization at 20-, 40-, 60-, 80- and 100-cm depths. Soil samples were taken at 60 locations between 14- and 114-cm depths to determine soil properties, water retention, and saturated hydraulic conductivity. Prediction of hydraulic parameters from basic and extended soil properties yielded low correlation coefficients. Water content could be predicted reasonably with neural networks from soil properties or hydraulic parameters (0.880~{$<~$}R~{$<~$}0.942). Prediction of \texttheta (t) based solely on rainfall data was not accurate. Independent networks could accurately simulate water content from one observed \texttheta (t) based on the Nash-Sutcliffe Model Efficiency and Percent Bias. Once a network is trained for a particular depth, accurate predictions can be made beyond the training period using observations at just one location.},

  abstract = {Accurate estimation of soil moisture content is necessary for optimal management of water and soil resources. Soil moisture is an important variable in the hydrologic cycle, which plays an important role in the global water and energy balance due to its impact on hydrological, ecological, and meteorological processes. The purpose of the present study was to explore a newly developed hybrid intelligent model for simulating soil moisture content. A hybrid adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model-grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm was designed here and validated against the neural network (ANN), support vector regression (SVR) and standalone ANFIS models. The models input parameters were di-electric constant, soil bulk density, clay content and organic matter of 1155 soil samples. Various statistical indices were employed to evaluate the performances of the applied models. For a reliable ranking of models, the Global Performance Indicator (GPI) was utilized, which is a 5-agent index. The results evidenced the feasibility of the developed hybrid ANFIS-GWO model with superior simulation results. At the testing stage, the MAE and SI values for the ANFIS-GWO were 1.468\% and 0.098, respectively, which indicated the superiority of the ANFIS-GWO compared to the ANFIS-Fuzzy C mean (MAE\,=\,6.427\%, SI\,=\,0.354), and ANFIS-sub clustering (MAE\,=\,2.137\%, SI\,=\,0.141) models. Based on the GPI, the ANFIS-GWO model was ranked as the best model, followed by the standalone ANFIS and SVR models, while the worst accuracy was attained through ANN model. The ANFIS-GWO model improved the simulation accuracy by 48\% and 50\%, respectively, compared to the standalone ANFIS and SVR models. In addition, based on the GPI, the ANFIS-GWO model presented an enhancement of about 77 percent compared to the ANN model. The high accuracy of the ANFIS-GWO model compared to the standalone ANFIS model represents the performance of the GWO algorithm for escaping local optima, which makes the ANFIS-GWO as a powerful tool for estimating soil moisture. Overall, the explored hybrid intelligent models demonstrated a reliable pedotransfer function of soil moisture where it can contribute to several geo-sciences engineering principles.},
